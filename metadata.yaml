description: Personal friends but philosophical opponents, Shaw and Chesterton had
  in their day great debates in print and in person that were both entertaining and
  notorious. In Chesterton's provocative biography of the playwright, he reveals keen
  insights into Shaw, his literary works, and his political and philosophical views.
  In equal parts witty and perceptive, the book illuminates both men in the process.
